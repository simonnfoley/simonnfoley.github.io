Z specifications and proof scripts for the paper "A Kernelized
Architecture for Multilevel Secure Application Policies", European
Symposium on Research in Computer Security, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium,
September 1998, Springer LNCS, to appear.

Files *.tex contain individual Z sections with esorics98.tex acting as
the root LaTeX file (no sections). Files *.prf contain the proof
scripts. For copyright reasons (LNCS) I've removed the prose from 
the specs, although in 12 months from publication I'm allowed to
make everything available. 

Uses Z/EVES Version 1.5 from ORA Canada (www.ora.ca.on).

To check just "make" and go for a coffee break.
